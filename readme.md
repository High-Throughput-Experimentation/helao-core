# HELAO-core

HELAO-core encompasses the API data structures used by Caltech HTE group's instrument control software following [HELAO](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-kr87t) design principles. This package is **independent** of [HELAO-async](https://github.com/High-Throughput-Experimentation/helao-async). See the instrument control software contained in the HELAO-async repo is the working application of these structures.
